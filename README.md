Ambient Display Project
Athing2do is an ambient display with the objective to remind daily high-level activities. 
For example sport, family, school, social and entertainment. 
Although the solution is oriented to solve the classic problems that parents experience forgetting their child activities, 
this solution is also easy configurable for multiple purposes in the context of remembering activities.
